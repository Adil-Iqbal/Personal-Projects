# Organize by Extension 
## by Adil Iqbal
### Installation
* Drag and drop the Python file "obe.py" in a desired location.
* Open the command line by typing "cmd" in the search bar of the Start Menu.
* In command line, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the script.
### Usage
* You can run the script directly from the command line using the following syntax:
* C:\Users\JohnDoe\Desktop> obe.py C:\Users\JohnDoe\root_directory
    * In this example, the user "John Doe" has stored the Python file on the desktop.
    * The "root directory" arguement denotes the directory that you would like to organize.
### Caveats
* Running this script on any directory will obliterate any pre-existing directory architecture.
* This may affect the performance of applications stored in the organized directory.
* Please run this script with extreme caution!
